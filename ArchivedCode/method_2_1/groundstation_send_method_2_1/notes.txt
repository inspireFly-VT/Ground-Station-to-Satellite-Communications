Hey, this is Wills McGraw just writing some quick notes in case some one
clicks through here to see whats up.

This is just me trying to mess around with the format we have for
sending method 2. It's pretty much the same as groundstation_send_method_2,
just with a bit more organization and changing up how functions are called.

It's very much not done but I don't quite got time to finish it before leaving for Thanksgiving break.
I'ma try to get back to it when I got time or when I get back from break,
whichever happens first.
