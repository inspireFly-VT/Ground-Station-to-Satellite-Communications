Hey, this is Wills. I'm writing down some notes in case anyone else checks out the method 2 sending. I'm gonna write down my ideas
so I don't seem crazy/someone can understand what I'm doing.

My idea is to get the satellite to send down the number of packets it'll send.

Then create a list of that size for bytearray objects with every value as None. I'll call this packet list for now.

Then have the satellite send down every packet. Note, the packets will contain information on indices. Store the packet data
in the given index in packet list.

Next, compile a list of all the indicies in the packet list that still have the value of None. If it still has the value of None,
then either the fcs number was incorrect or the groundstation simply didn't receive that packet.

Send that list to the satellite, then have the satellite send down the packets at the given indices.

Then this process repeats until every packet was sent and received properly.
